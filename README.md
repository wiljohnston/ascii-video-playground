# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Quickstart

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Changing images and videos

Head to src/images and add your own image/video files.

Then, in app.js, simply change the imports.

- Play around with the various controls documented by the [aalib](http://aa-project.sourceforge.net/aalib/) developers.
- Check out the [tutorial](https://www.cssscript.com/convert-images-videos-ascii-art-aalib-js/) I used to create this playground (although not line for line as the video code didn't quite work for me)
